# Pong
If you have heard about Pong before, you might have a pretty good understanding of my game already.
To the poeple who do not know what pong is, I will explain it here :)

Pong is a two or single player game where you play against an opponent. Either an ai or a different player. The game resembles ping pong where you hit a ball, if a player is unable to hit it, and the ball goes out of bounds the opposition gets one point. In stead of rackerts you have walls you are controlling. You move the walls using the arrow keys.

In contrast to regular pong my game is single player, and the objective is to keep the ball in play as long as possible. You get a score depending on how long you could hold the ball in play.

When you start the game, you get two options, one easy mode and one hard mode.
Press 1 for easy, 2 for hard. 

Easy Mode:
You controll two walls, one on the left side of the screen and one on the right. The ball is not able to go out of boound on the top or bottom of the screen. 

Hard Mode:
You controll four walls, one on the left side of the screen, one on the right side, one at the top, and one at the bottom. The ball can now go out of bounds at the top and bottom of the screen.
