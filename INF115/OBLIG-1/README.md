### csv2db This script imports CSV data into an SQLite database.

### Download it from git, you can also download the python code, in the folder "/python_code".

## Before you run
The script reads a CSV file and inserts the values into a SQLite database. It assumes that the CSV file has a header with the column names, if not you can add this manually. It also assumes that the SQLite database has tables with the same names as the CSV columns.

## How to run
You can either run it from ther terminal, or directly left double-click it. 
When you run you will be asked to firstly give the path to the db relative from where you have run the script aswell as the relative path to the csv file. If you do not know the relative path to your respective files, you can run the script from the same directory as you have your .db and .csv files. 

Lastly you can press enter to exit the script after the values has been inserted to the database.
